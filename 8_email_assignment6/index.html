            <h1>November Alpaca Newsletter</h1>

            Hello <span class="newsletterName"></span>,

            we heard that you are thinking of buying an Alpaca.

            <h2>Why keep Alpacas?</h2>
            Alpacas have a range of personalities. Some are boisterous and playful, some determined and proud, while others are passive and shy. They are curious about whatâ€™s going on around them, bond with other herd members and, most importantly, are great fun to be around.

            <h2>Who keeps Alpacas?</h2>

            Today alpacas are raised by breeders, fibre producers, farmers seeking agricultural diversification, smallholders looking for a sustainable lifestyle business, country landowners who want to grace their pastures with something beautiful - and people who just adore alpacas.

            So <span class="newsletterName"></span>, do you want to be one of them?
